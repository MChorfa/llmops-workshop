# LLMOps Workshop 

## Delivery Guide  
   
This page is designed to assist **instructors** in effectively delivering the **LLMOps workshop**.

The workshop is structured into **six lessons**, each comprising conceptual slides and hands-on **lab exercises**. Instructors are encouraged to adapt the content based on their experience and the needs of the audience.

The hands-on activities can be demonstrated by the instructor if the students prefer. For instance, we suggest that the **first lesson's lab** could be presented as a **demo** to introduce participants to the tools without disrupting the timeline of future lessons.
   
### Preparation  

Each lab has its **prerequisites** and **setup** section for the **hands-on** part, detailed at the beginning of the respective lab. If participants are expected to engage in hands-on activities rather than watch a demonstration, it's good practice to have them check the prerequisites and complete the setup **before** starting the practical exercises.


### Planning the Workshop  
   
When planning the workshop session, consider that each lesson has an **estimated duration**, including time for presenting slides and conducting hands-on exercises or a demonstration.  

> The duration may vary based on factors such as class size, level of interaction, internet speed, and the technical proficiency of the participants. 

This workshop is structured to span over an 8-hour duration, encompassing all lessons. However, the length can be tailored to the participants' needs, permitting shorter sessions or emphasis on particular topics.

### Delivery Examples  
   
Here are some suggestions for workshop configurations, which can be adjusted based on specific needs.  
   
| Description | Content | Duration | Lessons | Total Time |  
|-------------|---------|----------|---------|------------|  
| Full Workshop | All Topics | Two Days | D1: 1,2,3; D2: 4,5,6 | 8h |  
| Shorter Version | Introduction + Building + Evaluating and Deployment | Half Day | 1,2,3 | 4h |  
| Optimized Version | Short Intro + Building + Evaluating and Deployment | Half Day | 1(partial), 2,3 | 3h |
   

> For the Optimized configuration, use the first hour to present the following content from the workshop slide deck: *LLMOps Applying MLOps concepts to LLM Apps* section from Lesson 1 and the slides from Lessons 2 and 3. Then spend the next two hours on Labs 2 and 3.

### Additional Recommendations

Instructors should be prepared to either run the lab exercises as a demo or have a pre-recorded video available as a backup in case of any unforeseen circumstances.

For virtual format, it's recommended to cap sessions at 4 hours, incorporating breaks between lessons to sustain participant engagement and productivity.
